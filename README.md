# Cell-Check
A project that uses [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [SpatialLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index) (using the [golang driver](github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)) to evaluate cell coverage for a given Lat/Long (United States only).

Cell coverage information obtained from [The FCC](https://us-fcc.app.box.com/s/f220avmxeun345o6gzr7rwcnp1wslocf) (Last refresh of the data was July 2021)
